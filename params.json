  "body": "### Introduction:\r\nThe MEME Suite can be found at [http://meme-suite.org/](http://meme-suite.org/).\r\n\r\nDemonstration adapted from Bailey TL, Johnson J, Grant CE, Noble WS (2015) [The MEME Suite.](http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/W1/W39) _Nucleic Acids Res_ **43**(W1):W39-49\r\n\r\n### Motif Discovery using MEME:\r\nOn the [MEME page](http://meme-suite.org/tools/meme), upload a FASTA file containing amino acid sequences from five proteins, [Hiller2004.1.fa](https://github.com/khk31/meme/blob/master/Hiller2004.1.fa), under the **Input the primary sequences** section. In the **Select the site distribution** section, select _one occurrence per sequence_. In the **Select the number of motifs** section, tell MEME to find _1_ motif. Click on the **Advanced options** section, and tell MEME to find motifs of _length 11_ (select _11_ for both the _Minimum width_ and the _Maximum width_. Click **Start Search** to submit the job. When the job is completed, click **MEME HTML output** to view the **Discovered Motif**. You can click the arrow under **More** in the top row of the page to increase the size of the logo. \r\n\r\n### Motif Scanning using MAST:\r\nYou can submit the motif discovered through MEME in the previous step,  by clicking on the arrow under **Submit/Download** in the top row of the MEME HTML output page. Choose to **Submit Motif** to **MAST**; this brings you to the MAST page. The MAST page indicates that you'd submitted motifs (the _Submitted motifs_ option is automatically selected in the **Input the motifs** section). Upload the _Plasmodium falciparum_ proteome to MAST, by going to the **Input the sequences** section, selecting the _Upload sequences_ option under the **_User supplied_** sub-heading in the drop-down menu and thereafter uploading a [FASTA file ](https://github.com/khk31/meme/blob/master/Plasmodium_falciparum.ASM276v1.24.pep.all.fa) containing amino acid sequences from the _Plasmodium falciparum_ proteome. Click **Start Search** to submit the job. When the job is completed, click **MAST HTML output** to view the proteins within the _Plasmodium falciparum_ proteome that contain the query motif, and the location of the query motif within each of these sequences in a block diagram format. You can hover your cursor over the blocks for more information.\r\n\r\n### Motif Comparison using Tomtom:\r\nYou can key in motifs manually (e.g., in plain text, or as matrices) in the **Input query motifs** section on the [Tomtom page](http://meme-suite.org//tools/tomtom). Try **AAAGATCA** (hover your cursor over the text box to see a logo representation of the motif). Leave all other settings at their default mode, and click **Start Search** to submit the job. Tomtom scans numerous databases containing motifs, such as UniPROBE, JASPAR and CIS-BP. Notice how Tomtom aligns your query motif against the database motifs on the Tomtom results page.",
